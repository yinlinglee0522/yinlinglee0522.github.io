	<p>The role I pick is designer, and the website I choose to perform the accessibility evaluation is <a href="http://alumnus.alumni.umich.edu/notable-alumni/">Notable Alumni</a>.</p>

	<h1>Suggestion 1</h1>
	<h2>Increase the contrast between the color of the header text and its background.</h2>
	<p>Some of the header text, including global navigation and sub-navigation such as "HOME", "MAGAZINE ARCHIVE", and "NOTABLE ALUMNI" have low contrast between itself and its background. This website should (1) brighten the color of "HOME"; (2) darken the color of "MAGAZINE ARCHIVE" and "NOTABLE ALUMNI" to provide enough contrast.</p>

	<h1>Suggestion 2</h1>
	<h2>Provide clearer signifiers regarding which element has the keyboard focus.</h2>
	<p>When users use the keyboard to navigate, the website displays a border around the user interface control which receives focus. However, this border is really thin so it is not visible enough. The website should show clearer focus states by making the borders thicker.</p>

	<h1>Suggestion 3</h1>
	<h2>Rely on more characteristics as indicators for operating content.</h2>
	<p>The website only uses shapes — a circle and a plus sign — to indicate places for users to slide down the content hidden in each alumni section. The website should use a combination of more characteristics as indicators, such as shapes and captions saying "See more", to communicate the operations.</p>

	<h1>Suggestion 4</h1>
	<h2>Include text for social media icons.</h2>
	<p>The social media icons in the footer are links containing no text, and this can cause confusion for screen reader users. The website should include text for these icons as additional screen reader-friendly experience to make this information more accessible.</p>
